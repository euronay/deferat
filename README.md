# Deferat

A simple blog engine for displaying markdown formatted posts written in .NET Core. Used on my personal site, [jamesnaylor.dev](https://jamesnaylor.dev)

## Usage

Simply run:

```
dotnet run -p src
```

You can siply put your posts into the existing `Posts` directory and your author details in `Authors`. Or you can set the `POSTS` or `AUTHORS` envirnoment variables to use you own location.

To read how to format posts, read the [example post](/Posts/example-post/index.md)
