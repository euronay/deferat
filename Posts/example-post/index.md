#### It's an example post!

To use Deferat, simply write your files in markdown with the following header information. Put the `.md` file in a directory under `Posts` - the name of the directory will become the ID of the post. Place any supporting files in the directory and they will be included.

```

| `imageCredit` | Credit for the post header image |
| `featured` | This post will appear on the home page |
| `draft` | Set this to true for your post not to appear in any lists or searches. You can preview it by nagivating directly to the post url at `https://<your server>/Posts/Read?id=<post id>` (The post id is the directory)|


### It's markdown! ###

Your post will be formatted beautifully. This is a [link](#)</a> and some *italic* and some **bold**

This is a list

You can include code snippits:

```c#
Console.Out.WriteLine("Hello, World");
